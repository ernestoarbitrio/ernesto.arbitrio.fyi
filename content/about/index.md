#### ![me](me-avatar.png) Ciao! 👋

I am *Ernesto Arbitrio* an 🇮🇹 Software Engineer.

Maybe we have met each other on Mastodon [@pamaron](https://mastodon.social/@pamaron) or GitHub [@ernestoarbitrio](https://github.com/ernestoarbitrio>) before.

Considering I do not use social networks often, so you probably don't know me! Let me introduce myself:
I build analytics software products for a living, I started programming Python in 2008, sometimes I do speak at PyCon conferences.

#### Personal Projects 📒

Beside my professional projects I also invest some of my spare time in personal projects:

- [Histolab](https://github.com/histolab/histolab) a library for Digital Pathology Image Processing.
- [Pytest Runner](https://github.com/ernestoarbitrio/pytest-runner) a Visual Studio Code extension useful to run pytest locally and on a 🐳 docker container.

#### Speaking 📢

I have been speaking for several years at PyCon Italia, PyData and Europython and also some meetups (Pytrento, Python Pizza).
You can find some of the slides for my talks [here](https://speakerdeck.com/pamaron).

#### Short Bio 👤

I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Crunch.io](https://crunch.io/team/) / YouGov.

I am a Python passionate (almost addicted).

I am actively involved in the [PyCon Italia](https://www.pycon.it) organization.
